# Forecasting New York City's Future Water Demand

Welcome to the repository for the New York City Water Demand Forecasting Project. This project is dedicated to predicting the future water demand in New York City using historical data spanning from 1979 to 2019. Our goal is to provide valuable insights for urban planning, resource management, and policy-making through data-driven analysis.

## Project Overview

This project applies machine learning and time series forecasting techniques to predict NYC's future water needs. We analyze historical trends, develop predictive models, and provide forecasts that can help in efficient resource management and strategic urban planning.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle: [NY Water Consumption in the New York City](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/new-york-city/ny-water-consumption-in-the-new-york-city). This dataset includes annual figures on water consumption in New York City from 1979 to 2019.
